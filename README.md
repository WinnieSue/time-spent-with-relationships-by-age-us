# time-spent-with-relationships-by-age-us
Who are American spending their time with.
The data that I used here is from Makeover Monday. The data is tells us who Americans spent their time with and has been group in relationships.
I have used line graphs to see the time per relationship.
You will notice that I re-labeled the columns because the original column names were too long. These were easier to work with.
I then went ahead and plotted indicidual subplots. These were my way of practising subplots but gave me some insight into the data.
I also used boxplots but they didn't give me a clear interpretation of my data so I continued and did all my line plots on one graph. Here the results are clear. Below os the final graph.
I used seaborn style in this exercise
